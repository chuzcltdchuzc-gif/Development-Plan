# CLAUDE.md

AquaSavannah LandVault — a Nigerian land-registry/verification platform, rebuilt from scratch on Claude Code after full security/architecture audits of two prior implementations (`docs/audits/`). **Current status: Phase 2 (Development Environment) in progress — B0.0 scaffold landed: backend B0 kernel (fail-closed config, structured logging, RFC-7807 errors, health checks — tests green, lint/mypy clean), frontend F0 shell (Next.js App Router + Tailwind — builds clean), Docker Compose (Postgres+PostGIS, Keycloak, backend, frontend) and a Terraform baseline. Docker Compose has not been booted end-to-end in any session yet — no Docker daemon has been available in the environment this was built in; the backend was instead verified directly via `uvicorn` (real HTTP requests, not just TestClient) and the compose YAML was schema-checked, but neither is a substitute for an observed `docker compose up`. Cloud (staging/production) environments do not exist yet — Terraform has real version pins but no provider/resources (AWS vs. Azure is still an open decision, see `docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md` §6).**

This file is the always-loaded operational summary. It is a pointer, not the source of truth — if anything here ever conflicts with the documents it points to, **those documents win.**

## The 5 non-negotiable rules (full detail: `docs/ENGINEERING_RULES.md`)

1. **No new entity/table without an RLS/authorization policy in the same commit.** (Base44 shipped wallet/invoice entities with unconditional public update access — this is the exact bug class that rule prevents.)
2. **No permissive fallback default on any security-relevant env var.** Missing config must fail startup, never silently degrade to an insecure default. (Emergent's CORS wildcard-with-credentials and hardcoded signing-secret fallback.)
3. **Exactly one authorization path: the PDP/PEP/PIP engine.** No parallel/legacy auth system, no unguarded dev-login, ever — not even temporarily. (Emergent's dual auth system + unauthenticated admin bypass.)
4. **Every scoring/validation function fails safe:** zero/missing data → low or neutral result, never a passing score. (Base44's trust engine reported 100/A+ with zero real evidence.)
5. **Never mark something complete without having actually observed it pass.** Static code inspection is not evidence — run the test, see it pass.

## Where to look for more

| Need | Go to |
|---|---|
| The technical build plan (stack, 13 bounded contexts, stages, milestones) | `docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md` |
| Process/quality gates per phase, the Claude Code Loop, standing review questions | `docs/PHASE_GATES.md` |
| Definition of Done (Feature / Sprint / Product tiers) | `docs/DOD.md` |
| Full engineering rules, incl. when to stop and ask a human | `docs/ENGINEERING_RULES.md` |
| Why a specific architectural decision was made | `docs/adr/` |
| The audit findings everything above is derived from | `docs/audits/` |

## Repo layout

```
/frontend   — Next.js + TypeScript (F0 shell landed; bounded-context UI stages land per docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md §3)
/backend    — Python + FastAPI (B0 kernel landed in app/kernel/; one folder per bounded context as B1+ land)
/infra      — Terraform (version-pinned baseline, no provider yet), Docker (infra/docker/docker-compose.yml)
/docs       — this planning package
```

## Working model

Sprints are one per bounded context (13 total, dependency-ordered per `docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md` §1), each gated through the Claude Code Loop in `docs/PHASE_GATES.md` and signed off against `docs/DOD.md` before merge. Do not start a sprint whose dependencies (per the bounded-context ordering) aren't yet Sprint Done.

## Build/test/run commands

**Backend** (from `/backend`):
```
python -m venv .venv && .venv/Scripts/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/Scripts/pytest                 # unit tests
.venv/Scripts/ruff check .           # lint
.venv/Scripts/mypy app tests         # type check
.venv/Scripts/uvicorn app.main:app --reload   # run locally; needs env vars, see .env.example
```

**Frontend** (from `/frontend`):
```
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build && npm run start       # or `npm run dev` for local development
```

**Full stack** (from repo root, requires Docker):
```
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in real values
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```
Not yet verified in any session — see the status note above.
